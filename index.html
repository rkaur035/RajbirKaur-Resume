        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I am Rajbir Kaur and I am a Biology major. I am currently in my third year at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently looking for opportunities to get more hands-on experience at vets (possibly a vet tech), as my future aspiration is to become a veterinarian. Ever since I was little, I have always loved animals and wanted to help them in any way possible. I have many past work and personal experiences that would make me a great candidate for this position. <br><br>

        To start off with, my first job was at a call center. I took calls from potential customers and helped place their orders. This job really helped me develop good customer service and communication skills. I had to talk to people on the phone for hours straight. Each person was different, with a different personality, therefore I had to change the way I approached them to match their preferred way of communication. A lot of the time, people were kind, however there was also a good amount of individuals who were upset. These individuals were usually upset that their order was lost, or incorrect. Through this, I learned how to navigate through situations where people are distressed. I always tried to empathize with them and find the best possible way to accommodate their needs. This skill of good customer service is one that will come in handy at any profession.<br><br>

        I have also volunteered for a pet grooming company, to really solidify my aspirations of being a vet. There I learned how to work with different types of animals and their owners. For instance cats require more effort to “trick” than dogs. I found that learning that giving them a toy to play with is the best way to get them to remain calm. I also learned that dogs are way more prone to injuries due to their outgoing and carefree nature. Not only did I get an insight at animal care, I also got to interact with the owners of said animals. Most of the time the owners were very involved with a detailed set of instructions of how to groom their pets; Most even provided an allergy list without asking. This emphasized the importance of their pets. I was not just caring for animals, I was caring for somebody’s best friend. <br><br>
        
        A personal experience that would make me a great candidate for this position comes from my experiences with my own pets. When I was growing up my family had a german shepherd. He and I were always together. He would watch and guard me while I was outside playing with my friends, and he would always accompany me and watch all my favorite TV shows with me. However as he got older, he started developing some major health problems. It seemed like his personality completely shifted. He seemed uninterested in everything.  Most of the vets said that there was not anything they could do, and that he would forever remain this way. However, one vet shifted my dog’s outlook on life. He made it a point to make treatment and vet visits fun for him. He never let him leave without a tail wag. This made my german shepherd more inclined to get care, even excited for it. We saw this shift at home where he started to regain interest in his favorite things again. This made my whole family and I greatly happy. That specific vet’s kindness and dedication to make my best friend’s visits fun made such a big impact. I hope to do the same for other families.
